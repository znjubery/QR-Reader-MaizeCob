This repository houses a Python script designed to rename image files according to the information encoded within QR codes.   

The script scans PNG, JPG, or JPEG files within the input folder, detecting QR codes within images and renaming files accordingly. Dependencies include the Pyzbar library for QR code detection and decoding.
